Welcome to my TiddlyWiki (TW) dedicated to the //KaTeX TW5 Plugin// for mathematical typesetting, based on Khan Academy's KaTeX. It is fully self-contained and does not need an Internet connection to work.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just took what was [[already done|https://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/katex]] and updated the [[KaTeX files|https://github .com /KaTeX/ KaTeX/releases/]]. All credit goes to the original authors, and the works follow their licenses. Some sources :

* https://katex.org

The plugin adds 0.8&nbsp;MB to the TW 5.3.0 empty file size (2.3&nbsp;MB), for a total of 3.1&nbsp;MB. KaTeX fonts in the WOFF2 format were used, which occupy 254 kB, instead of the 296 kB of the WOFF format, representing a reduction of approximately 15%.

In addition, I have also included the Regular Latin [[Open Sans|https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts/open-sans?subsets=latin]] font (18 kB) in the plugin. The [[Fonts]] tiddler has a list of available fonts, which can be used normally anywhere in TW. They can even be used as the Notebook's default font, see //Font family// and //Code font family// in the [[ControlPanel|$:/ControlPanel]] of this TW. Other fonts can be easily added using the Node.js version of TW, just download the WOFF2 file, place it in the plugin's //fonts// directory, and add an entry in //styles.tid//.
