Welcome to my TiddlyWiki Notebook dedicated to the KaTeX TW5 plugin for mathematical typesetting, based on Khan Academy's KaTeX. It is fully self-contained and does not need an Internet connection to work.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just took what was [[already done|https://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/katex]] and updated the [[KaTeX files|https://github .com /KaTeX/ KaTeX/releases/]]. All credit goes to the original authors, and the works follow their licenses. Some sources :

The plugin adds 0.8&nbsp;MB to the TiddlyWiki 5.3.0 empty file size (2.3&nbsp;MB), for a total of 3.1&nbsp;MB.
