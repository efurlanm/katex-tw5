title: Using KaTeX
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The usual way to include ~LaTeX is to use `$$`, as shown in the examples below.

The underlying KaTeX widget is provided under the name `<$latex>` and is also available under the alias `<$katex>`. It's better to use the generic `<$latex>` name unless you are running multiple ~LaTeX plugins and wish to specifically target KaTeX.
