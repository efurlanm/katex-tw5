# katex-tw5

*Last edited: 2024-12-10*

Wrapper for [KaTeX 0.16.9](https://katex.org/).

You can install the plugin by navigating to the TiddlyWiki

http://efurlanm.github.io/katex-tw5

and dragging the plugin link to your TiddlyWiki.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just took what was already ready and updated KaTeX to the latest version, and kept only the KaTeX WOFF2 fonts.

All credits are from the original authors :

As I didn't make the plugin, I have no idea how to eliminate issues. Please contact the original authors.
