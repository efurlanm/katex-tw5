# katex-tw5

Wrapper for [KaTeX 0.16.8](https://katex.org/). TiddlyWiki notebook including the plugin :

http://efurlanm.github.io/katex-tw5

You can install the plugin by navigating to the site and dragging the plugin link to your TiddlyWiki.

I'm not the author of the plugin, I just got what I was already ready, and updated the files to the latest version. All credits are from the original authors :

As I didn't make the plugin, I have no idea how to eliminate issues. Please contact the original authors.
